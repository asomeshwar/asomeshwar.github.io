Adolescents’ self-perceptions play a crucial role in shaping their personality development, yet research often treats self-esteem as a unitary construct, overlooking the distinct roles of domain-specific competencies. This study investigates how both global self-worth and domain-specific self-perceptions, measured by the Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents (SPPA), relate to Big Five personality traits, measured via the BFI-10, across multiple developmental time points. Drawing on data from the Transitions in Adolescent Girls (TAG) longitudinal study (N = 174), we analyze daily-diary self-reports collected across up to six waves spanning early to mid-adolescence.
We first establish the empirical factor structure of the SPPA using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and test its longitudinal measurement invariance via confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Model fit is evaluated using multiple indices (CFI, TLI, RMSEA, SRMR), and factor retention is guided by theoretical alignment and statistical rigor. Where full invariance is not achieved, partial invariance is tested to retain robust constructs for longitudinal analyses.
To examine developmental trajectories, we employ multilevel modeling (MLM) with lagged predictors, modeling self-perception and personality as both outcomes and predictors over time. Age and time since last assessment are tested as moderators. Additionally, a random intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) is used to disentangle within-person (state-like) and between-person (trait-like) dynamics, allowing for directional inferences between personality traits and self-perception factors. We explore whether changes in self-perceptions precede shifts in personality, or vice versa, and test for age-specific periods of influence by modeling developmental transitions in 18-month intervals.
Findings from this study will clarify how adolescents’ views of themselves in specific domains contribute to the evolving structure of personality, advancing theoretical models of self-concept and trait development during adolescence.
