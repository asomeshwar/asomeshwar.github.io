Adolescence marks a critical phase of relational renegotiation between parents and children, characterized by evolving perceptions of behaviors, expectations, and autonomy. This study examines parent-child agreement on relational dynamics (e.g., warmth, hostility, monitoring) from ages 10 to 16 among Mexican-origin youth from 674 families. To capture the complexity of these dynamics, we employed multilevel modeling to estimate latent correlations among informants. Findings reveal how agreement and discrepancies in relational perceptions evolve with age and vary by gender. Parent-child agreement was moderate overall, with higher agreement observed for dyadic behaviors (e.g., relationship quality) than individual behaviors (e.g., yelling at child). Both boys and girls showed greater agreement with their dads and parents aligned more closely with their children’s views when rating their spouse’s behavior rather than their own. Parents and children agree most in their perceptions of parent hostility and least on perceptions of parent monitoring. These results underscore the importance of considering developmental, gendered, and cultural factors in understanding family dynamics.
