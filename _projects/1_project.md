This study explores the daily associations between specific friendship experiences and adolescent girls’ mental health. While close friendships are known to have both positive and negative impacts on mental health, prior research has often examined broad, static indicators of friendship quality rather than specific and dynamic characteristics. By focusing on daily fluctuations in both specific friendship experiences and mental health outcomes,  this study aims to identify which friendship experiences are most strongly linked to well-being in adolescents’ everyday lives. The sample included adolescent girls (N = 90, M = 16.67) who, for ~30 consecutive days, self-reported on the experiences of their single closest friendship—such as feeling supported, trusted, or lonely—and mental health symptoms including both positive well-being and internalizing. Multilevel models were used to examine how daily changes in these friendship perceptions related to positive and negative mental health. Results indicate that daily perceptions of supportive friendship experiences, like feeling valued, understood, and secure were associated with positive well-being, such as greater happiness and self-confidence, while daily perceptions of negative friendship experiences, like feeling rejected and lonely, were correlated with increased daily symptoms of depression and anxiety. These findings underscore the significance of specific friendship experiences and suggest that daily diary assessments can provide a nuanced understanding of the dynamic impact of friendships on adolescent mental health. By capturing day-to-day variations, this study contributes valuable insights for designing targeted interventions to support youth mental health through strengthening key aspects of close friendship quality.
