My research centers on adolescent development, particularly the dynamics of dyadic relationships and the impact of perception discrepancies on psychological outcomes. I explore how adolescents perceive themselves versus how they are perceived by significant others, primarily parents and peers, and how these discrepancies influence key developmental outcomes like mental health, self-esteem, and relationship quality.

### **Dissertation Title:** "Navigating Adolescence: The Dynamics of Dyads, Perception, and Personality in Youth Development"

*Key Themes & Constructs*

-   Perception Discrepancies: Mismatches between adolescentsâ€™ self-views and the views held by parents and peers.

-   Dyadic Relationships: Bidirectional and dynamic interactions within parent-adolescent and peer-adolescent dyads.

-   Longitudinal and Daily Experience Methods: Use of both long-term data and daily diary methods to track development and interaction patterns over time.

-   Self-Esteem and Mental Health: Outcomes linked to the degree of alignment (or misalignment) in perception.

-   Relationship Quality: How congruent perceptions within dyads affect closeness, conflict, and overall satisfaction.

### **Methodology**

I use:

-   **Mixed-effects modeling** (e.g., `lmer`) for nested data.

-   Network analysis to study structure changes across time.

-   **Multi-method data** combining surveys, behavioral ratings, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and observer coding.
